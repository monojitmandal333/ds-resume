      \begin{itemize}
          \resumeItem{
            Developed an Inventory to Order matching and assignment tool for a Steel Manufacturer to optimize yield, 
            reduce Inventory level and improve Service Level using a Multi Objective Greedy Heuristic algorithm.
            Considering dimension, quality and chemistry as matching criteria, model was able to match best the Inventory to Order 
            leading to $\sim$2.5 \% point extra yield and reduced the risk of material 
            degragation and risk of not meeting order promise date by prioritizing older materials ($\sim$7 days) 
            to older coils ($\sim$14 days).
          }
          \resumeItem{
            Designed and Developed a Tail Spend Supplier Negotiation Tool for big Retailers/FMCG/CPG client to help automate negotiation
            process with their suppliers using a chatbot agent to reduce workload on manual negotiations by $\sim$50\%. The tool leverages
            GPT-4o-mini model in an Agentic framework to generate competitive offers within bounds of the levers set by the client. 
          }
          \resumeItem{
            Developed a POC MILP model for an energy retailer/distributor company to optimize Vessel Routing and 
            Scheduling process more efficiently to reduce Fixed Cost, Port operating cost, Demurrage Cost while
            considering multiple factors like Inventory levels, Vessel utilization, port demand, berth availability etc

          \resumeItem{
            Developed a Generalized Linear Model (Poisson's Regression) with $\sim$50 \% $R^2$ to predict and recommend optimal controllable 
            parameters range to bring down rejections (due to quality reason) of Regrigerated Frozen Baked Goods products, leading to expected 
            savings of $\sim\$$800 M/year.

          \resumeItem{
            Developed a Regression Tree model with $\sim$55 \% $R^2$ to predict rejection rate of Hard Taco Shell Manufacturing Line and suggest
            optimal operating ranges of process control parameters to reduce rejection by 70-80 \% leading to $\sim\$$ 1 MM
            yearly.
