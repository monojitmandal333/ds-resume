            Developed an Inventory to Order matching algorithm for a Steel Manufacturer to optimize yield, 
            Inventory and Service Leve using a Multi Objective Greedy Heuristic based optimization model. 
            Considering dimension, quality and chemistry as matching criteria, model was able to pick the 
            best order for inventories leading to $\sim$2.5\% better yield and selected older materials ($\sim$7 days) 
            to older coils ($\sim$ 14 days) to reduce risk of material degradation and risk of not meeting target 
            date for orders when compared against existing manual process.
